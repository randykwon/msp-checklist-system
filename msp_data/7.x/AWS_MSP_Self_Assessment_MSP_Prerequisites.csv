SECP-001,"Access Key Exposure Detection
Mandatory

AWS Trusted Advisor checks popular code repositories for access keys that have been exposed to the public and for irregular Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) usage that could be the result of a compromised access key.

It is critical that AWS MSP Partners actively monitor these events and create mechanisms to ensure they are responded to quickly.

The AWS Partner must implement an automated mechanism for handling all AWS Health events with service type “RISK” in all managed customer accounts. At a minimum, an automated system must be in place to create new tickets in an ITSM or security ticketing system at the highest severity when exposed access key notifications are received. See Learn to Detect & Mitigate Account Compromise Issues (https://partnercentral.awspartner.com/apex/WebcastMain?Id=a1G0h00000CXSz3EAH) for an example solution.

Additionally, the Partner must have a documented procedure for handling exposed credential notifications that includes deleting or rotating the exposed credentials.
